    <font style="color: pink;font-size:xx-large;">My Personal information</font>
    <p>Hello, My name is YanyiDong, You can call me Gary.
      I come from Beijing of China, Beijing is the capital of China and I start living in Beijing when I born, Now I am 26 years old.
      I touch a little bit knowledge about HTML before 5 years, at that time, I studied in a college in Beijing.
      But now I almost forget anything about HTML, basically,
      it can’t be used in people`s daily life.</br></br>
      
        My mother tongue is Chinese, I speak Mandarin in my daily life. 
        But I especially love to listen Cantonese Songs. 
        In term of my social, my student number is S3735844.
        My private E-mail is Dongyanyi1994@gmail.com. 
        I graduated from Beijing Youth Politics College in 2016,  
        it is a Junior College.
        this is why I have to get a bachelor degree before I start my master project.</br>
      </br>I like learning cooking when I have free time. 
      I always cook food which I think delicious, for my girlfriend, but she doesn’t think so. 
      Also, I can play basketball, I was obsessed with playing basketball when I was in high school. 
      but it just in my high school. 
      In China, every Chinese have to focus on the study. 
      Because the College entrance examination can decide your destiny. 
      At that time, I need a chance to release my stress.
       So playing basketball became my favourite sport. 
       the other reason is the Basketball court is closest to my classroom than other sports courts.</br></br>

      <font style="color: rgb(119, 156, 236);font-size:xx-large;">My interest in IT</font>
     </p>
    <p>
      Why I choose IT？One hand I have fundamental of IT Because I learned some knowledge before 5 years, 
      Although I don’t use them for a long time， 
      when I meet them I can understand fast, because it has been remembered in my brain. 
      The other hands, my big brother who graduated from information technology at Monash University. 
      He tells me a lot of things about IT, like big data, AI etc. also I find some pieces of information about other majors on the internet.
       By contrast, I think IT more suits me. 
       I more like to communicate with a computer. 
       After that, IT become my major.  </br></br>
       I would like to know some knowledge which can be used in the AI aspect. 
       because I would like to do some job with AI. even if I didn’t know what AI is :)
      But my friends always push me learning knowledge about AI when I start my project.

    <div class="b1"></br></br><img src="2.png" width="320" height="640"></br><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50307455?type=standard#%22searchRequestToken=44a8ef08-912a-4cd6-8f99-7f6ce45d94d9">about my ideal job</a></font></div>
    <div class="a3">this is my ideal job

      <p>I would like to do this job because the job is accountable for Design and develop messaging/chat software with the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. Also, Contributing system analysis, solution (functional & technical) design and feasibility activities.those two reasons makes me choose this job. In my mind, I belives that the workplace and university is a similar thing, it both makes people acquire knowledge. Just a part of people can’t understand that.they just make money by the workplace. This job can let me get a lot of knowledge about AI and software testing. meanwhile, it has a good income. But if I apply for this job now, I don't have any opportunity.  Because I don’t have any ability that required.

        the following paragraph shows information about my plan.
        if I would like to join this company.i have to improve by the following three aspects. Firstly, I have to learn some mainstream programming language like C language, PHP, Python. Now, that language I don't understand yet.so if I choose this company , I have to know those languages. At least, I can use that to do some fundamentals. it doesn’t a simple thing. when I get those languages, the next step is that I will find a small company to do some work that should be used in those languages. In this time, My proficiency in these languages has greatly improved. it is not a short term, Probably it will spend approximate 1 years or more time. after that, I have a new understanding of IT. it makes me more confident to do some IT works. Speaking of this, I have an opportunity to receive my offer.

      <p>In this result, I am a Turbulent Advocate. Indeed, I often encourage my friends and people around me.even if I am not a leader, I can encourage do what someone does him best. also, I can encourage someone to do what they can’t do. So I think I good for a team. But  Turbulent Advocate only one is enough in one team.

   <div class="a5"><font style="color: #A569BD;font-size: xx-large;"><p>My project ideal</p></font>
  <p>I would like to design a application about shopping. it is called "YeeBuy".</br></p>
  </br><p> More and more people worry about that during the COVID-19 pandemic if people stay at home how can we deal with the food shortage problem.
   Because in this period, people go to the market probably can increase the sick risk. 
   The Supermarket giants should update their system for Customer convenience. 
   Also, in order to avoid more and more company broken because of COVID-19, this app can acquire goods information from supermarket giants. 
   For example, someone would like to bug some milk, he can get the information about the remaining inventory of supermarket giants and buy it, and then automatically match nearby couriers for delivery. 
   Efficient is the most important feature of the app. because if people order something from Coles or Woolworth app, it will be slow. 
   As people know, people would like to eat something suddenly this feeling can’t remain a long time. 
   Once people can’t have it in several hours, they usually lose this feeling.in other words, if I want to eat an apple, I order some apples in Coles app. 
   Those apples probably delivery in next day. But beyond these several hours probably I wouldn’t like to eat the apple. 
   If I do this not only waste money, it but also don’t make me enjoy. the purpose of this app in order to make an efficiency bridge between customers and supermarket, Not just in this special period. 
It is true that more and more people also don`t have enough free time to buy necessities.</p>
  <p> In this paragraph, I would like to show people some details about this app. First of all, this APP includes some functions. For example, people can get the price of the same goods price from different supermarkets in this app, it good for the customer to buy the good price one. It can be used on a mobile phone, or other portable devices like Apple watch or others. Like I mentioned before, and then people can order online, next, the app can automatically match nearby couriers. Costumer just waiting for half hours, his order can be delivered. Because in the process, the most time-consuming step is the preparation of people’s order goods by the supermarket. Meanwhile, the courier is on the way. For the customer, the app is an efficient way to buy what they want to buy. It also is a positive impact on the market economy, more and more people would like to order they like by the app because it needn't people to have free time and it good for people's work, people can focus on their work, don't worry about that we make up free-time to buy necessities. With the rapid development of the modern economy, compared to people's income, people needn't save this Delivery fee. Because using this time to accompany families is the best choice. In this way, family members will be closer. In the other hand, it supplies a new work position. It needn't people to have high education degrees and Full-time. People also can get high-salary same that. But people have to work hard. Because the basic salary is not high, if a courier successfully delivered order, the courier can get a certain percentage of income from it. People can do this work when they Are commuting. This work can be seen as a part-time job. It also can be seen as a full-time job. It depends on people's time. It can bring a lot of work opportunities for people, because of low skill requirements. It differs from the takeaway. In term of usage frequency，usage frequency of the app much more than that of takeaway, people can use this app to buy anything that people would like to buy, not only food. For people who would like to find a job, they needn't worry about how to become a courier, just register an account. Next, they can receive messages before they were working, the message included information about where they will go and what they need to pick up, and then Navigator can tell them how to go. In short, This app has great convenience for consumers and people who want to find a job.</p>
  </p>Now, I am going to describe Tools and Technologies. Firstly, I need to design a website. The website includes front-end and back-end, the front -end will use CSS and JavaScript, in term of back-end, it will connect the database, it suitable for customers to order online. Also, it improves staff's work efficiency. Maybe it will use SQL etc. For the advertisement, Probably Big-data technology can make the right decision to advertise. For example, Big-data can summarize the customer's shopping preferences, And then accurately advertise what they need. Finally, the app had better be used on a mobile phone, we have to design a Smartphone’s app, because of a large number of people who use the mobile phone as we know. this part is about the customer. In the next part, It is related to the courier. To be honest, this part needn’t a lot of IT technical, Of course, the software of this app has different interfaces for couriers and customers and merchants. The simplest is the interface for merchants. Only the id of the courier and the required goods are required. For the interface of the courier, it contains a navigator. And the goods that need to be collected at the merchant. The navigator can be opened with Google Maps By Java. For the customer's interface, it needs to have clear classifications and advertisements suitable for them. As I mentioned earlier, it needs big data to support. All of code, I recommended a Programming software which is Visual Studio Code. It can do anything code or language.</p>
<p>At the end of the article, I would like to illustrate the outcome; the app will change people's shopping style. Older people don’t have to worry that they cannot carry the goods they want to buy. In the other hand, More and more courier can be seen on the road. It means it more and more efficient because it has a lot of options. It can match the most suit courier for you.

    <font style="color: pink;font-size:xx-large;">My Personal information</font>
    <p>Hello, My name is YanyiDong, You can call me Gary.
      I come from Beijing of China, Beijing is the capital of China and I start living in Beijing when I born, Now I am 26 years old.
      I touch a little bit knowledge about HTML before 5 years, at that time, I studied in a college in Beijing.
      But now I almost forget anything about HTML, basically,
      it can’t be used in people`s daily life.</br></br>
      
        My mother tongue is Chinese, I speak Mandarin in my daily life. 
        But I especially love to listen Cantonese Songs. 
        In term of my social, my student number is S3735844.
        My private E-mail is Dongyanyi1994@gmail.com. 
        I graduated from Beijing Youth Politics College in 2016,  
        it is a Junior College.
        this is why I have to get a bachelor degree before I start my master project.</br>
      </br>I like learning cooking when I have free time. 
      I always cook food which I think delicious, for my girlfriend, but she doesn’t think so. 
      Also, I can play basketball, I was obsessed with playing basketball when I was in high school. 
      but it just in my high school. 
      In China, every Chinese have to focus on the study. 
      Because the College entrance examination can decide your destiny. 
      At that time, I need a chance to release my stress.
       So playing basketball became my favourite sport. 
       the other reason is the Basketball court is closest to my classroom than other sports courts.</br></br>

      <font style="color: rgb(119, 156, 236);font-size:xx-large;">My interest in IT</font>
     </p>
    <p>
      Why I choose IT？One hand I have fundamental of IT Because I learned some knowledge before 5 years, 
      Although I don’t use them for a long time， 
      when I meet them I can understand fast, because it has been remembered in my brain. 
      The other hands, my big brother who graduated from information technology at Monash University. 
      He tells me a lot of things about IT, like big data, AI etc. also I find some pieces of information about other majors on the internet.
       By contrast, I think IT more suits me. 
       I more like to communicate with a computer. 
       After that, IT become my major.  </br></br>
       I would like to know some knowledge which can be used in the AI aspect. 
       because I would like to do some job with AI. even if I didn’t know what AI is :)
      But my friends always push me learning knowledge about AI when I start my project.

    <div class="b1"></br></br><img src="2.png" width="320" height="640"></br>https://www.seek.com.au/job/50307455?type=standard#</br>searchRequestToken=44a8ef08-912a-4cd6-8f99-7f6ce4</br>5d94d9</font></div>
    <div class="a3">this is my ideal job

      <p>I would like to do this job because the job is accountable for Design and develop messaging/chat software with the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. Also, Contributing system analysis, solution (functional & technical) design and feasibility activities.those two reasons makes me choose this job. In my mind, I belives that the workplace and university is a similar thing, it both makes people acquire knowledge. Just a part of people can’t understand that.they just make money by the workplace. This job can let me get a lot of knowledge about AI and software testing. meanwhile, it has a good income. But if I apply for this job now, I don't have any opportunity.  Because I don’t have any ability that required.

        the following paragraph shows information about my plan.
        if I would like to join this company.i have to improve by the following three aspects. Firstly, I have to learn some mainstream programming language like C language, PHP, Python. Now, that language I don't understand yet.so if I choose this company , I have to know those languages. At least, I can use that to do some fundamentals. it doesn’t a simple thing. when I get those languages, the next step is that I will find a small company to do some work that should be used in those languages. In this time, My proficiency in these languages has greatly improved. it is not a short term, Probably it will spend approximate 1 years or more time. after that, I have a new understanding of IT. it makes me more confident to do some IT works. Speaking of this, I have an opportunity to receive my offer.

      <p>In this result, I am a Turbulent Advocate. Indeed, I often encourage my friends and people around me.even if I am not a leader, I can encourage do what someone does him best. also, I can encourage someone to do what they can’t do. So I think I good for a team. But  Turbulent Advocate only one is enough in one team.</div>
